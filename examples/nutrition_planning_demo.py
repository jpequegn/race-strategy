‚úÖ Personalized carbohydrate recommendations by race duration and intensity
‚úÖ Sodium requirements accounting for environmental conditions
‚úÖ Hour-by-hour nutrition scheduling with practical adjustments
‚úÖ Environmental risk assessment and adaptation strategies
‚úÖ Integration with overall race strategy and pacing

The nutrition module provides evidence-based recommendations while
remaining flexible for individual preferences and race-day adjustments.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Sports nutrition science compliance (30-90g carbs/hour guidelines)
‚Ä¢ Environmental adaptation (heat/humidity impact on sweat rate)
‚Ä¢ Personalized calculations (body weight, experience level)
‚Ä¢ Practical scheduling (reduced first hour, flexible final hour)
‚Ä¢ Safety limits (maximum sodium intake capped at 800mg/hour)
‚Ä¢ Contingency planning (GI distress, overheating protocols)

For race day success, always practice your nutrition strategy during
training and have backup plans ready!
